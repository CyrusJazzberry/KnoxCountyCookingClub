# KnoxCountyCookingClub
A mod for Project Zomboid, which itself is an overhauled edition of my old mod, [Use Stuff as Spices](https://github.com/CyrusJazzberry/usestuffasspices).</br>
This edition adds more types of craftable foods, and ways of making certain things renewable.</br>

Check the version changelogs for more in depth info!
