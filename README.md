# KnoxCountyCookingClub
A mod for Project Zomboid, which itself is an overhauled edition of my old mod, [Use Stuff as Spices](https://github.com/CyrusJazzberry/usestuffasspices).</br>
This edition adds more types of craftable and forageable foods, and tweaks some vanilla items to either have nutritional value or forage definitions.
